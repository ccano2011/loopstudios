## Overview

_**loopstudios** is a simple landing page built with React & Styled-Components. This project came from a prompt provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/loopstudios-landing-page-N88J5Onjw)._

## MVP

<!-- > The Minimum Viable Product should be a well-planned, easily-communicated product, ensuring that the client's deliverable will be achievable and meet specifications within the time frame estimated. -->

<!-- _The **Project Title** MVP lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus dapibus fermentum risus vitae bibendum. Integer vel ipsum mollis odio sollicitudin ornare eu vel ex. In quis fringilla velit, ac maximus quam. Etiam eget placerat neque. Aenean faucibus sem non nisi lobortis ullamcorper._ -->

- Build a proper responsive Front-End application that changes layouts depending on the browser window size, utilizing only styled-components for the responsive design

<br>

### Goals

- _Test my React knowlegde/best practices_
- _Improve my CSS/Styled-Components abilities_
- _Create a template so that I may be able to use this for future projects_

<br>

### Libraries and Dependencies

<!-- > Use this section to list all supporting libraries and dependencies, and their role in the project. Below is an example - this needs to be replaced! -->

#### Component Hierarchy

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure

<!-- #### Component Breakdown

> Use this section to go into further depth regarding your components, including breaking down the components as stateless or stateful, and considering the passing of data between those components.

|  Component   |    Type    | state | props | Description                                                      |
| :----------: | :--------: | :---: | :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |

|    Footer    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The footer will show info about me and a link to my portfolio._ | -->

#### Time Estimates

<!-- > Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above. -->

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Determine  the Component Hierarchy |    H     |     20 minutes      |     20 minutes     |     TBD     |
| Add the content|    H     |     10 minutes      |     20 minutes     |     TBD     |
| Style & Test |    H     |     5 hrs      |     7 hrs     |     TBD     |
| Deploy & Test |    H     |     1 hrs      |     30 minutes     |     TBD     |
| POST-MVP Mobile Styling |    H     |     3 hrs      |     TBD     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |    9.5 hrs      |     8hrs 10min,     |     TBD     |

<!-- > _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._ -->

## Post-MVP:

<!-- > Use this section to document ideas you've had that would be fun (or necessary) for your Post-MVP. This will be helpful when you return to your project after graduation! -->
<!-- - Build out logic that will prevent duplicate RSVPs -->
- Mobile Styling w/ Hamburger menu
- Learn specific CSS tricks for sizing and passing images in as props to styled-components
<!-- - Implement Full CRUD to the RSVP component -->
